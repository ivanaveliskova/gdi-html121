                <p class='header__introduction'>This is my intro paragraph. It will have a full screen background image and the whole page will be fully responsive without the use of media queries. Images on this page can be found at: <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a>. We are going to need to clean it up. A lot!</p>
                <p>Itâ€™s a bit more exciting when you go the other way. I don't know. But I'd probably blame the English. I've made many mistakes... and it's about time that I did something about that. Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head? The Doctor. Nosey parker. Shut it, Hoodie! No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. So you've got a room for not being awake in. What's the point? You're just missing the room!</p>

                <p>I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Allons-y! Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors!</p>
