<p>Hello HTML 102 students!</p>

<p>Thanks again for attending the Intermediate HTML/CSS class. I apologize again we were not able to cover all of the material. Your feedback is very valuable to making this class better.</p>

<p>Please fill out the class survey to let the organizers and me know what you thought of the class: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/XFs2C2AxV3B2m5n82">https://goo.gl/forms/XFs2C2AxV3B2m5n82</a></p>

<p>Wondering what to take next? See the "Suggested Course Sequences" document that's on our Meetup site, under the tab "Pages", which can give you some guidance.  Here's a direct link: http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Philadelphia/pages/Suggested_Course_Sequences/ .  In particular, I would recommend the Intermediate HTML/CSS class (201) or Intro to JavaScript.</p>

<p>Finally, GDI Philly is on Slack, and we'd love for you to be part of the conversation! There's a sign up sheet on our Meetup site: under the tab "Pages", click on "Get Involved", and choose "Join our Slack Team".
